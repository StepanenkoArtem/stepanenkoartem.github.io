            <h2>Ceramic Turkish Cezve is ideal to do this!</h2>  
            <section class="text left">
                <p>Thick sides of ceramic turkish pot hold heat very well, due to this the process of making coffee continues even after you take your cezve away from fire. Coffee continues to boil in the ceramic cezve. The cezve has a conic shape and a neck that is three times narrower than the bottom. When the coffee starts to boil, the neck plugs with coffee grounds, that’s why coffee preserves its excellent aroma and taste. The result is close to the coffee prepared on scorching sand, as in this case the ceramics is very close to sand by its features. Besides this, ceramics has porous structure that allows this beverage to get rich of oxygen and this also intensifies the aroma. Thus, coffee boiled in ceramic cezve results extremely tasty.</p>

            <section class="text right">Ceramic cezve may be washed as any other utensil, but never wash hot cezve in cold water! It may crack. Give it a little time to get cold before you wash it. The cezve has a wooden handle. It’s handy and safer than with a metal handle, you will never burn your hand. Neither use the cezve on heavy fire! Use fire distributor or the weakest fire on your gas stove.</section>
            <section class="text left">We should note that water in ceramic cezve warms up slowly and gets cold slowly as well. You should consider this peculiarity when making coffee in ceramic cezve. It may happen that you have already taken Turkish coffee pot away from fire but coffee continues boiling and may even boil over. That’s why you need to take cezve away from fire a little beforehand, before the boiling.  It’s also good to use such a cezve on charcoal or electric stove. Remember that slow cooking makes coffee’s taste richer.</section>
